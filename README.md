AtliQ Hardware is a consumer goods electronics company having operations in various countries. They used to use Excel to implement data analytics to make data-driven decisions. However, the competitive market is ever-changing, and their business is overgrowing, so only relying on Excel is insufficient to let the company stand out. As a result, the senior executives decided to discard Excel and use SQL to import data and visualise data by using Power BI to generate business insights.
